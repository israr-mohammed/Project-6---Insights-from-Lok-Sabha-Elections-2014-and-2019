# Project-6---Insights-from-Lok-Sabha-Elections-2014-and-2019
ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement:
AtliQ Media, a private media company, aims to produce a show on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India. Unlike conventional channels focusing on election predictions, AtliQ seeks to provide unbiased insights from data analysis of the 2014 and 2019 elections. The goal is to explore overlooked topics such as voter turnout percentage. A data analyst is tasked with deriving meaningful insights to deliver informative content on electoral dynamics in India.
